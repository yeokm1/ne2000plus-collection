 -------------------------------                                                                               
                                                                                
 NOTE: Before installing the NDIS drivers, please make a note of the
       configuration of your NE2000PLUS adapter. Run the PLUSDIAG Utility to 
       obtain the following information:

                A. Adapter Architecture : Programmed I/O or Shared Memory
                B. Port Address
                C. Interrupt setting

 NOTE: The NDIS Drivers supports only 286 or higher machines.

 LAN Manager 2.2 And OEM Verions:
 -------------------------------
                                                                                
 New Installations: DOS or OS/2
 ------------------------------

     1. Follow the procedures outlined in the Microsoft Lan Manager 
        Installion Guide for instructions on running the SETUP utility.

     2. When SETUP prompts you to select a network adapter driver, choose 
        the "OTHER DRIVER" option and press ENTER or click on OK.

     3. Insert the NE2000PLUS Additional Drivers Diskette into drive A and 
        press ENTER or click OK.

     4. The SETUP utility will display "NSC AT/LANTIC NDIS 2.01 Driver". 
        Press ENTER or click OK.

     5. Select the protocol you wish to use with the NE2000PLUS and then press 
        ENTER or click OK.

     6. Follow the rest of the instructions as per your LAN Manager 
        Installion Guide.

     7. If you changed the default settings (I/O Mode, 300h, 3) on your 
        NE2000PLUS adapter, you'll need to edit the PROTOCOL.INI located in the 
        LANMAN.DOS (DOS Installations) or LANMAN (OS2 Installations) on 
        your hard drive. Edit the section [ETHAT2_NIF] and change the 
        IOBASE, INTERRUPT, or RAMADDRESS (Needed only for Shared Memory 
        Mode) to the correct values. See the NDIS Device Driver Configuration 
        section for more details.

     8. Installation complete. Reboot your machine to load the drivers.
                                                                                
   Note: For earlier versions of LAN Manager, refer to the Installion Guide                                                                             
         for information on importing network drivers. The same steps are 
         used if LAN Manager is already installed on your hard drive.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                


 NDIS DEVICE DRIVER CONFIGURATION                                             
 --------------------------------                                                                              
   
   The I/O base address and interrupt level can be configured on the LAN 
   Adapter for Ethernet using the PLUSDIAG.EXE program supplied on the Driver
   diskette. The NDIS device driver must be configured to match the adapter's 
   configuration.  The NDIS device driver can be configured manually by 
   editing the PROTOCOL.INI file. A detailed description of the configurable                
   parameters follows:                                                          
                                                                                
                                                                                
   IOBASE = This parameter specifies the adapter I/O Base address that will     
            be used by the device driver to access the adapter registers.       
            The value entered must be one of 240h, 280h, 2C0h, 300h, 320h, 340h       
            or 360h.  The default is 300.                                        
                                                                                
            EXAMPLE:  IOBASE = 0x300                                              
                                                                                
   INTERRUPT = This parameter specifies the interrupt level used for            
               notifications between the workstation and the network            
               adapter card. Ensure that no conflicts exist between             
               the various system components in their use of interrupts.        
               The value entered must be one of 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, or 15.      
               The default value is 3.                                          
                                                                                
               EXAMPLE:  INTERRUPT = 3                                          
                                                                                
   RAMADDRESS = This parameter specifies the physical location of the           
                adapter in the memory of the computer. The specified            
                location must not conflict with that of any other adapter       
                installed in the workstation or with an address that is         
                used by a memory manager.  The value entered must be a         
                hexadecimal number between C0000 and D0000 and must be a
                multiple of 4000. The default address is D0000.       
                                                                                
                EXAMPLE:  RAMADDRESS = D0000                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
      Note: The NDIS device driver anticipates the mode of the adapter, 
            either programmed I/O or shared memory, by the presence of the 
            RAMADDRESS= statement in PROTOCOL.INI.  If the RAMADDRESS= 
            statement is specified, it is assumed that the adapter is in 
            shared memory mode.  If the RAMADDRESS= statement is not specified, 
            it is assumed that the adapter is in programmed I/O mode. If the 
            NDIS device driver is configured for the wrong adapter mode, an 
            error message will be displayed during system initialization.                                                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
   The NDIS device driver section of PROTOCOL.INI can be created manually.
   An example of a PROTOCOL.INI section for the NDIS device driver follows.                                                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
                      [ETHAT2_NIF]                                                  
                      
                        Drivername = ETHAT20$                                   
                                                                                
                        IOBase = 0X300                                          
                                                                                
                        Interrupt = 2                                           
                                                                                
                        RAMAddress = 0XC0000                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
   Finally, the desired protocol driver(s) must be "bound" to the NDIS          
   device driver by manually editing the BINDINGS= statement of those           
   protocol drivers.  An example follows:                                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
                      [PROTOCOL_DRIVER_ABC]                                     
                                                                                
                        Bindings = ETHAT2                                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
 NDIS DEVICE DRIVER SUPPORT FOR TWO ADAPTERS                                  
 -------------------------------------------
                                                                                
   When two NE2000PLUS Adapters are installed in the same system, there           
   must be two DEVICE= statements in CONFIG.SYS and two NDIS device driver          
   sections in PROTOCOL.INI.  An example follows:                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
       CONFIG.SYS:    DEVICE=C:\..path..\ETHAT2.OS2
