 ----------------------                                                         
                                                                                
 To install the driver during installation of the Windows for Workgroups        
 Operating system or when upgrading to Windows for Workgroups from              
 Windows, use the follow instructions:


    1. Follow the procedure outlined in the Microsoft Windows For
       Workgroups Manual for starting Setup.

    2. When Setup prompts you to Select New Network Adapter, choose
       "Unlisted or updated Network Adapter" and press ENTER or click
       OK.

    3. Setup will prompt you to insert the diskette which contains the 
       NDIS driver for the new adapter. Insert the NE2000Plus Additional 
       Drivers diskette and press ENTER or Click OK.

    4. Setup will display the network adapter driver to be installed, 
       National Semiconductor InfoMover NE2000Plus. Press ENTER or Click OK.
       (When prompted for which disk drive contains your InfoMover Diskette,
       enter the drive designator without the backslash. For Example, enter
       A: instead of A:\.)

    5. When prompted for the disk containing the new PROTMAN.DOS, insert 
       your Windows For Workgroups Disk #8 into drive A and press ENTER 
       or Click OK.

    6. Setup will then prompt you to insert the disk with the updated or
       vendor-provided ETHAT2.DOS driver. Place the NE2000Plus Additional
       Drivers Disk into drive A and press ENTER or click OK.

    7. Insert the Windows For Workgroups Disk #8 into drive A and press 
       ENTER or click OK.

    8. Setup now prompts you for the NE2000Plus adapter configuration. If the 
       adapter is configured for the default settings (I/O Mode, 300h, 3)
       press ENTER or click OK. If the adapter is not using the default
       settings, change each option shown to reflect the settings for 
       your adapter.

       NOTE: When using Shared Memory Mode, you must configure the Memory
             manager you are using to exclude the 16k block used by the
             NE2000Plus adapter. For example, if you used the default Shared
             Memory Address, you must exclude D000-D3FF. The parameter
             EMMExclude=D000-D3FF should be added to the SYSTEM.INI in the
             [386Enh] section. The user must manually edit the PROTOCOL.INI 
             located in the Windows directory and add the 
             RAMADDRESS= statement. See the NDIS Driver Configuration section 
             for more details.
               
    9. The NE2000Plus installation is complete. Follow the instructions 
       displayed by Setup to complete your Windows For Workgroups 
       installation.


 To install the driver once the operating system is already installed:          
 --------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                
         
    1. Choose "Network" under the Control Panel.
   
    2. If you have a network installed other than Windows For Workgroups, 
       i.e. Novell Netware, LAN Manager, etc., you must remove the network 
       option first before Windows will allow you to remove the driver. 
       Choose "NETWORKS" from the Network Settings screen and remove the

       settings, change each option shown to reflect the settings for 
       your adapter.

       NOTE: When using Shared Memory Mode, you must configure the Memory
             manager you are using to exclude the 16k block used by the
             NE2000Plus adapter. For example, if you used the default Shared
             Memory Address, you must exclude D000-D3FF. The user must 
             manually edit the PROTOCOL.INI located in the Windows 
             directory and add the RAMADDRESS= statement. See the NDIS

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                


 NDIS DEVICE DRIVER CONFIGURATION                                             
 --------------------------------                                                                              
   
   The I/O base address and interrupt level can be configured on the LAN 
   Adapter for Ethernet using the PLUSDIAG.EXE program supplied on the Driver
   diskette. The NDIS device driver must be configured to match the adapter's 
   configuration.  The NDIS device driver can be configured manually by 
   editing the PROTOCOL.INI file. A detailed description of the configurable                
   parameters follows:                                                          
                                                                                
                                                                                
   IOBASE = This parameter specifies the adapter I/O Base address that will     
            be used by the device driver to access the adapter registers.       
            The value entered must be one of 240h, 280h, 2C0h, 300h, 320h, 340h       
            or 360h.  The default is 300.                                        
                                                                                
            EXAMPLE:  IOBASE = 0x300                                              
                                                                                
   INTERRUPT = This parameter specifies the interrupt level used for            
               notifications between the workstation and the network            
               adapter card. Ensure that no conflicts exist between             
               the various system components in their use of interrupts.        
               The value entered must be one of 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, or 15.      
               The default value is 3.                                          
                                                                                
               EXAMPLE:  INTERRUPT = 3                                          
                                                                                
   RAMADDRESS = This parameter specifies the physical location of the           
                adapter in the memory of the computer. The specified            
                location must not conflict with that of any other adapter       
                installed in the workstation or with an address that is         
                used by a memory manager.  The value entered must be a         
                hexadecimal number between C0000 and D0000 and must be a
                multiple of 4000. The default address is D0000.       
                                                                                
                EXAMPLE:  RAMADDRESS = D0000                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
      Note: The NDIS device driver anticipates the mode of the adapter, 
            either programmed I/O or shared memory, by the presence of the 
            RAMADDRESS= statement in PROTOCOL.INI.  If the RAMADDRESS= 
            statement is specified, it is assumed that the adapter is in 
            shared memory mode.  If the RAMADDRESS= statement is not specified, 
            it is assumed that the adapter is in programmed I/O mode. If the 
            NDIS device driver is configured for the wrong adapter mode, an 
            error message will be displayed during system initialization.                                                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
   The NDIS device driver section of PROTOCOL.INI can be created manually.
   An example of a PROTOCOL.INI section for the NDIS device driver follows.                                                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
                      [ETHAT2_NIF]                                                  
                      
                        Drivername = ETHAT20$                                   
                                                                                
                        IOBase = 0X300                                          
                                                                                
                        Interrupt = 2                                           
                                                                                
                        RAMAddress = 0XC0000                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
   Finally, the desired protocol driver(s) must be "bound" to the NDIS          
   device driver by manually editing the BINDINGS= statement of those           
   protocol drivers.  An example follows:                                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
                      [PROTOCOL_DRIVER_ABC]                                     
                                                                                
                        Bindings = ETHAT2                                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
 NDIS DEVICE DRIVER SUPPORT FOR TWO ADAPTERS                                  
 -------------------------------------------
                                                                                
   When two NE2000Plus Adapters are installed in the same system, there           
   must be two DEVICE= statements in CONFIG.SYS and two NDIS device driver          
   sections in PROTOCOL.INI.  An example follows:                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
       CONFIG.SYS:    DEVICE=C:\..path..\ETHAT2.OS2                             
                      DEVICE=C:\..path..\ETHAT2.OS2                             
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
       PROTOCOL.INI:  [ETHAT2_NIF]
