 -------------------------------                                                                               
                                                                                
 NOTE: Before installing the NDIS drivers, please make a note of the
       configuration of your NE2000PLUS adapter. Run the PLUSDIAG Utility to 
       obtain the following information:
        
        A. Adapter Architecture : Programmed I/O or Shared Memory
        B. Port Address
        C. Interrupt setting

 NOTE: The NDIS Drivers only support 286 or higher machines.

  Installation Instructions:                                                    
    1) Create a subdirectory called VINES.
    2) Change to the VINES subdirectory.
    3) Place the VINES(R) LAN S/W (DOS) NO:INSTALL Diskette into drive
       A or B. 
    4) Type: COPY drive:*.* and press ENTER. 
        drive = The floppy drive which contains the VINES Diskette, A or B.
    5) Place the VINES(R) LAN S/W (DOS) NO: 2 OF 2 Diskette into drive
       A or B.
    6) Type: Copy drive:\NDIS\*.* and press ENTER.
        drive = The floppy drive which contains the VINES Diskette, A or B.
    7) Place the NSC Additional Drivers Diskette into drive A or B.        
    8) Type: COPY drive:\MSLANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\ETHERNET\ATLANTIC\*.* and
       press ENTER. This will copy the ETHAT2.DOS NDIS and PROTOCOL.INI 
       files to your VINES subdirectory.
    9) Run Banyan's PCCONFIG.EXE program and configure the Banyan software 
       to talk with the NDIS driver being used.                            
            -Select option 1 in PCCONFIG.
            -Page down the list and select NDIS ETHERNET.                   
            -Set the proper interrupt value. This value should correspond  
             with the interrupt that the NIC was configured to.            
            -Type ETHAT2 as the section header name of the NDIS driver.      
            -Press F10 to save the configuration. Press ESC to return to
             the main menu.
            -Select option 2, LOGIN ENVIRONMENT SETTINGS.
            -Select option 1, SELECT DEFAULT COMMUNICATIONS DRIVER.
            -Page down the list and select NDIS ETHERNET.
            -Press ESC to return to the main menu.     
            -Press F10 to save your configuration and exit.
    10) Edit the PROTOCOL.INI and add the header name as shown below.                 
    11) Edit the CONFIG.SYS and add the lines listed below.
    12) Reboot the machine.                                                 
    13) Change to the VINES subdirectory and run the BAN.EXE command. Be sure      
        you are attached to the same network as a VINES server.            
    14) The Banyan login prompt should come up signifying a successful      
        connection has been established.

        ; If the RAM address is included the driver will assume shared memory mode.
        ; The RAM address is entered as the physical address
        ; e.g. 0xd0000 is equivalent to 0xd000:0000 in segment:offset format
