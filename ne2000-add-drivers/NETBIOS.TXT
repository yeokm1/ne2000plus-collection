 NETBIOS for the National Semiconductor Corporation Ethernet Adapters                                              
 --------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                               
                                                                                
 NOTE: Before installing the NETBIOS driver, please make a note of the
       configuration of your NE2000PLUS adapter. Run the PLUSDIAG Utility to 
       obtain the following information:

                A. Adapter Architecture : Programmed I/O or Shared Memory
                B. Port Address
                C. Interrupt setting

 NOTE: This driver works only in Programmed I/O Mode. DO NOT configure
       the adapter for Shared Memory Mode.


INSTALLATION:
------------

To Install the NETBIOS using the accompanying INSTALL.BAT:  
  Change drives to the appropriate drive containing this diskette.   This
    may be either A: or B:. Then change the directories to the \NETBIOS
    directory.
  At the DOS prompt, type "install d" and press <return> where d is the 
    destination drive.  For example, to install from drive B: to drive C:, 
    type "install c" and press return.  This will copy the NETBIOS.EXE file
    to the root directory of drive C:.

To Install the NETBIOS without using the accompanying INSTALL.BAT:  
  Change drives to the drive from which the NETBIOS will be executed.
  Using the DOS COPY command, copy NETBIOS.EXE from the diskette to the
    root directory on drive C:.  For example, if the diskette is in drive A: 
    and NETBIOS.EXE will be executed from drive C:, you would perform the 
    following steps:
                     c: <return>
                     copy a:\netbios\netbios.exe c:\netbios.exe <return>

COMPATIBILITY:
-------------

This NETBIOS will work on the NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR's Ethernet Adapters.  
  NETBIOSes from different manufacturers may not be compatible with this 
  NETBIOS.  The NETBIOS provided by National Semiconductor is compatible
  with NETBIOSes provided by Performance Technology, Inc. In addition, 
  interoperable NETBIOSes for both XENIX and OS/2 are available for 
  NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR's Ethernet Adapter.
